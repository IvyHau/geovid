  <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
  <p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus, which has now spread worldwide. Currently, there are no available vaccines for global use. Because of that, it is important to study the spread of COVID-19, understand where, when, and how it occurred by studying the spatio-temporal patterns of confirmed cases.</p>
<p>This project aims to provide a web-based geospatial application to identify areas with COVID-19 and the factors affecting the spread. Most of the geospatial applications on COVID-19 are limited to visualizing proportional point patterns. However, our group is also concerned about the factors affecting the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Due to the limited number of COVID-19 data Singapore has to offer, our group has decided to focus on Hong Kong as the choice of study area as it offers more data as compared to Singapore. These data acquired from data.gov.hk include number of cases confirmed(active and/or discharged), location of quarantined areas (governmental and/or homes), which will be relevant to the analysis of the spatio-temporal patterns.</p>
<p>The web-enabled geospatial analytical tool is developed to allow users to view the spread of COVID-19, as well as how to better plan for further spread and its mitigation.</p>

<div id = "Objectives">
  <br/>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>Our group will focus on the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Visualize density of the COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong by performing relevant exploratory data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct global and local spatial analysis to find out spatial correlation patterns and influencing factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a web-based interface through R Shiny with relevant filters to display relevant data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate results based on the findings to understand the spread in Hong Kong, and provide recommendations to further mitigate the situation.</p>
</li>

  <h2>Data Preparation &amp; Analysis</h2>
  <h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
<p>Data of the cases of coronavirus in Hong Kong, the quarantine building list, means of transport, population, as well as testing, are obtained from data.gov.hk, the Hong Kong government’s open data source.</p>
<h3 id="data-cleaning-and-wrangling">Data Cleaning and Wrangling</h3>
<p>The data cases has to be clean to extract only data from January to September. Duplicates will also need to be checked to prevent skewed data analysis. Data Standardization will then ensure the same data types to ensure a fairer comparison and analysis.</p>
<h3 id="data-transformation">Data Transformation</h3>
<p>As the study analyses the intensity and relationships, the data has to be transformed to the relevant formats before more statistical analysis can be done. Such transformations are converting SpatialPointDataFrame to Point Pattern Processes. Shapefile for the geographic area will need to be converted to owin in order to analysis the points in the study area.</p>
<h3 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Exploratory Data Analysis will first be used to describe the data and general observations that could be observed</p>
<h4 id="globallocal-morans-i">Global/Local Moran&rsquo;s I</h4>
<p>Global Moran I will be used to analyse the autocorrelation of objects with the global area.</p>
<p>Local Moran&rsquo;s I will be used to analysed the autocorrelation on the local level.</p>
<h4 id="getis-and-ords-g-statistics">Getis and Ord&rsquo;s G-Statistics</h4>
<p>Getis and Ord&rsquo;s G-Statistics will be used to analyse the statistically significant hot and cold spots.</p>

<p>Case study reference link:</p>
<p>Yongzhu Xiong, Yunpeng Wang, Feng Chen et al. Spatial statistics and influencing factors of the novel coronavirus pneumonia 2019 epidemic in Hubei Province, China, 06 April 2020, PREPRINT (Version 2) available at Research Square [+https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-16858/v2+]</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Aim of study</strong></p>
<p>To understand spatio-temporal dynamic characteristics of COVID-19 to help with the prevention and control of the disease.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>i. Spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="litreview_cluster.png" alt="cluster"></p>
<p>Global spatial autocorrelation is used to measure the spatial characteristics in cases the entire region. Analysis is also done on the overall spatial correlation and spatial differences within the region. To compute the global spatial autocorrelation, Global Moran&rsquo;s I is used.</p>
<p><img src="litreview_getis.png" alt="getis"></p>
<p>Local Spatial aurocorrelation analysis such as Local Moran I is also done to indentify regions with high or low clustering significance.Getis-Ord Gi is later then used to identify the association between hotspots adn coldspots/</p>
<ul>
<li>ii. Statistical correlation</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="litreview_moran_zscore.png" alt="moran"></p>
<p>Pearson statistical correaltion was used to find out correlation between cases at prefecture level and county level, plus other indication (population, economy, environmental, etc).</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning Points</strong></p>
<p>Analysis has to take into consider the prefecture compared to the nationwide level. Cases at different level, such as provincial, prefecture, county, affects the results of the analysis.</p>
<p>Analysis was done to find out if covid-cases was significant to natural environment, population, and social and economic activities.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Areas of Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Perphaps there should be research done on the effects on lockdown and show it prevents the spread of covid-19. The information found will help with the planning of covid-19 measures.</p>
